# COMP 475 - 2D Graphics

Programming assignments for COMP 475 at UNC.


## Assignments

Since assignments are cummulative, the point at which an assignment is completed is marked with a tag. These tags can be browsed on the [releases page](https://github.com/cdriehuys/comp475/releases).


## Testing

### Unit Tests

Each new assignment comes with a few unit tests.

```shell
$ make tests
$ ./tests -v
```

### Images

Assignments also have a set of images that utilize the features implemented in the assignment.

```shell
$ make image
$ ./image -e expected -v
